Sometimes it turns out, after ages, that we finally meet someone who lives just a couple of villages away, but our paths have never crossed. Or they're in the next apartment block, but you'd never know they're also hunting for a small farm and binge-watching permaculture videos on YouTube.\n\n{siteName} is created and run by fellow Gaian volunteers with no profit motive. It is a safe space made to help us connect and find each other.",
