# OpenCupid

Free, open matchmaking application built to serve existing communities.

Within every circle ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a collective, association, ecovillage or shared-interest group ‚Äî there are countless valuable connections waiting to happen. Yet in real life, many of these remain hidden because the existing social network platforms don't facilitate discovery and members are often scattered all over the place. OpenCupid helps surface these connections in a safe and intentional way, facilitating their evolution into meaningful bonds ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs friendship, collaboration, or romantic partnership ‚Äî within the circles we already belong to.  

At its core, the platform is privacy-preserving and is based on reciprocity: you only see the details others choose to share if you‚Äôve shared the same information yourself, and only if your preferences match theirs. 

Consent is fundamental: nobody can approach you unless you‚Äôve explicitly given permission. This creates a safer, more respectful environment where connections can grow on mutual terms.  

Unlike commercial matchmaking apps, OpenCupid is free from dark patterns and manipulative design. There are no hidden algorithms trying to keep you hooked, no upsells, and no data exploitation. Just a simple, transparent tool that communities can use to connect their members in an open, fair, and trust-first way.

## Call for collaborators

If you like the aims and goals of this project and would like to improve it in some way, there are several ways to contribute:

* Run the software in your community
* OpenCupid currently speaks English and Hungarian. We are looking for help translating into other languages to make the software accessible to more communities. 
* Test the platform and file issues for bugs/problems you find (don't need to be a developer to do this)
* Work on open Github issues
